	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College.

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u'Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students. The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia.\r\nFounded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers prominent in the abolitionist and women\'s rights movements, including notable activist Lucretia Mott. Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation and became officially non-sectarian in 1933.\r\nToday, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of Swarthmore\'s Quaker heritage. Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, a rate surpassed only by the California Institute of Technology, Harvey Mudd College and Reed College.\r\nSwarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College, and Haverford College. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania\'s College of Arts and Sciences.',

	 'schoolinfo': u"The University of Toronto (U of T, UToronto, or Toronto) is a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated on the grounds that surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises twelve colleges that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs.\r\nAcademically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell research, and was the site of the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of Cygnus X-1 as a black hole, and the theory of NP completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States.\r\nThe Varsity Blues are the athletic teams representing the university in intercollegiate league matches, with particularly long and storied ties to gridiron football and ice hockey. The university's Hart House is an early example of the North American student centre, simultaneously serving cultural, intellectual and recreational interests within its large Gothic-revival complex.\r\nThe University of Toronto has educated two Governors General and four Prime Ministers of Canada, four foreign leaders, fourteen Justices of the Supreme Court, and has been affiliated with ten Nobel laureates. The university ranks 21st in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, 27th in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, and 19th in the QS World University Rankings.",

	 'description': u'Designed to help students build confidence in their public speaking skills, our Public Speaking Institute trains students in public speaking, logic and rhetoric through an interactive and dynamic curriculum that encourages incremental progress through ongoing practice and exercise. Over the course of the program, students will participate in three main courses: Debate, Persuasive Speaking, and an elective.\n\nDebate\n\nLearn the art of verbal combat! Students will learn how to construct persuasive positions, defend against and attack each other\u2019s arguments, and cross-examine effectively. Students will debate a variety of age- and experience-appropriate topics, form teams, and pit themselves against their co-campers. Past debate topics have included: school uniforms (elementary school), pre-emptive strike policy (middle school), and the legal drinking age (high school).\n\nPersuasive Speaking\n\nThis useful activity teaches students to craft and deliver convincing speeches. Students start by performing a number of pre-written speeches in order to learn delivery, timing, and intonation. When students display comfort with delivery, they will begin to construct speeches based on their interests. Students learn to choose topics, establish captivating introductions, organize speech content, and deliver compelling conclusions! The focus is on speaking in a natural voice, with few or no notes, rather than writing an essay and merely reading it out loud, the form of "public speaking" taught by most teachers. All students end the week by presenting a speech in front of a large group of fellow campers.\n\nElectives\n\nIn the evenings, students will get to choose from at least two of the following four elective speaking activities:\n\nModel Congress: This event provides an introduction to diplomatic and legislative speaking. Students role-play as members of Congress. Persuasive speaking, negotiations, and compromise are all stressed in a forum that allows students to sample the most exciting part of the political process!\n\nNegotiations: You can\'t always get what you want... or can you? The negotiations activity stresses public speaking as a business and personal tool. Students will role-play scenarios in which their abilities to compromise and persuade are developed.\n\nReader\'s Theater: In this fun and popular event, students write and perform a short play (or learn and perform a play for younger students). Students create their characters, devise plot twists, write dialogue, and deliver partial practice performances followed by the whole play.\n\nImprovisational Speaking: This type of speaking requires students to think on their feet to deliver speeches with little or no preparation time. In the opening class, students are given ample time to prepare for short speeches, and over the course of the program the time to prepare will shorten as the speeches lengthen. Fun and challenging topics are chosen, often with hilarious results!\n\nPublic Speaking Institute students experience university life during their week on a college campus. Students live together in the dormitories, experience campus dining, and relax on campus with a wide array of sports and arts activities. Additionally, the camp will take one mid-week excursion to a local attraction, such as an amusement park or sports venue. The most recurrent comment made by students after camp is, \u201c I never knew I would have so much fun!\u201d',

	 'description': u'Designed to help students build confidence in their public speaking skills, our Public Speaking Institute trains students in public speaking, logic and rhetoric through an interactive and dynamic curriculum that encourages incremental progress through ongoing practice and exercise. Over the course of the program, students will participate in three main courses: Debate, Persuasive Speaking, and an elective.\n\nDebate\n\nLearn the art of verbal combat! Students will learn how to construct persuasive positions, defend against and attack each other\u2019s arguments, and cross-examine effectively. Students will debate a variety of age- and experience-appropriate topics, form teams, and pit themselves against their co-campers. Past debate topics have included: school uniforms (elementary school), pre-emptive strike policy (middle school), and the legal drinking age (high school).\n\nPersuasive Speaking\n\nThis useful activity teaches students to craft and deliver convincing speeches. Students start by performing a number of pre-written speeches in order to learn delivery, timing, and intonation. When students display comfort with delivery, they will begin to construct speeches based on their interests. Students learn to choose topics, establish captivating introductions, organize speech content, and deliver compelling conclusions! The focus is on speaking in a natural voice, with few or no notes, rather than writing an essay and merely reading it out loud, the form of "public speaking" taught by most teachers. All students end the week by presenting a speech in front of a large group of fellow campers.\n\nElectives\n\nIn the evenings, students will get to choose from at least two of the following four elective speaking activities:\n\nModel Congress: This event provides an introduction to diplomatic and legislative speaking. Students role-play as members of Congress. Persuasive speaking, negotiations, and compromise are all stressed in a forum that allows students to sample the most exciting part of the political process!\n\nNegotiations: You can\'t always get what you want... or can you? The negotiations activity stresses public speaking as a business and personal tool. Students will role-play scenarios in which their abilities to compromise and persuade are developed.\n\nReader\'s Theater: In this fun and popular event, students write and perform a short play (or learn and perform a play for younger students). Students create their characters, devise plot twists, write dialogue, and deliver partial practice performances followed by the whole play.\n\nImprovisational Speaking: This type of speaking requires students to think on their feet to deliver speeches with little or no preparation time. In the opening class, students are given ample time to prepare for short speeches, and over the course of the program the time to prepare will shorten as the speeches lengthen. Fun and challenging topics are chosen, often with hilarious results!\n\nPublic Speaking Institute students experience university life during their week on a college campus. Students live together in the dormitories, experience campus dining, and relax on campus with a wide array of sports and arts activities. Additionally, the camp will take one mid-week excursion to a local attraction, such as an amusement park or sports venue. The most recurrent comment made by students after camp is, \u201c I never knew I would have so much fun!\u201d',

A professional staff of instructors with over twenty years in film, television and video production guides students through a fun and exciting educational experience. Dynamic instructors, a full program of elective activities and the latest production technology provide a nurturing environment with a challenging edge.\n\nCampers produce their first video on the first full-day and learn some of the basics of shooting quality footage. The second day presents a plunge into editing as campers produce a \u201cStory of a Mundane Task\u201d; turning an everyday event into a premier short film. Throughout the week, the complexity of the projects grows along with the student\u2019s skills and knowledge, developed through a fast-paced mix of instruction and exercises. Students analyze each others\u2019 work and compare it with popular film and television as they are inspired by their own improved skills.\n\nThe week ends with a screening of the students\u2019 movies for an audience of fellow-campers, family and friends. Each student takes home a DVD of their work and a Teen Filmmaker\u2019s Handbook, containing additional tips, tricks and instruction to help them continue to develop their video production skills.',

	 'description': u'Prep Camp Excel is for motivated rising 9th and 10th grade students seeking to excel in high school so that when college application time rolls around, they have attained the best possible GPA, resume, and course of study. This seven-day camp offers students exposure to many of the same principles that older students get at College Admission Prep Camp in a similarly relaxed and fun atmosphere. Prep Camp Excel uses a three-pronged curriculum to promote high school success, including courses in Essay Writing, PSAT Prep, and Study Skills.\n\nEssay Writing Writing competent essays is not only critical to getting good grades, but it is also one of the most important skills a student can take away from high school. Unfortunately, the kind of one-on-one instruction necessary in learning to write well is rarely available in schools. At Prep Camp Excel, students have the opportunity to work individually with experienced, first-rate teachers. Each student will bring home one of the best essays he or she has ever written, and most importantly, will have gained the knowledge of how to write more outstanding essays for the new school year!\n\nPSAT Prep and Test Taking Training The PSAT is a crucial test for college recruiting as well as for the National Merit Scholarship contest, yet most students go into the exam with little or no preparation. Excel campers will take two full PSAT exams over the course of the week. Our exclusive curriculum teaches math, grammar and vocabulary building skills, which not only prove invaluable for the PSAT but also for Math and English classes in high school. The two-year average PSAT score improvement of Prep Camp Excel students, measured by entrance and exit exams, is 16.2 points- the equivalent of 162 points on the SAT!\n\nStudy Skills Good students know that success in high school is not just about how much you know but about how you organize, display and use that knowledge. Our instructors will work with students in important areas that are often overlooked in the high school curriculum: high school planning, presentation skills, time management, and notetaking.\n\nLife On and Off Campus Planned recreational excursions allow students to experience local attractions, and on-campus evening and afternoon activities balance the academic day. Living in the dorms together encourages students to build close friendships that last through high school and beyond.',

	 'description': u'The High School Actors Workshop focuses on teaching the professional acting techniques that translate onto both stage and screen. Over the course of 14 days, students participate in a morning core course and choose from a variety of specialized afternoon electives. Students showcase their work in an extraordinary final performance, which includes monologue work and ensemble short scenes.\n\nAdmission Requirements Eligible students must be entering 9th-12th grade in order to attend the High School session of the California Actors Workshop. Students must demonstrate passion for acting and theater by having taken drama classes or planning to during high school. Students are required to submit a 250 word Personal Statement that explains their interest in acting and desire to attend the program.\n\nCore Curriculum The core curriculum for the Actors Workshop is an acting class that focuses on combining creative intuition with concrete technical skills. Following Stanislavski, students learn to tap into emotional truth while exploring how mental and physical techniques can nurture unconscious inspiration. Each morning, students will practice exercises that help them vocally project, physically tell stories, and emotionally and intellectually connect to characters. Both morning acting classes and afternoon rehearsals help students understand the basic building blocks of realistic acting such as playing objectives (what the character wants), obstacles (what stands in the way), and tactics (how the character tries to get around those obstacles to accomplish her objectives).\n\nElectives Elective offerings vary each year and depend on the specialty of the acting faculty. Possible offerings include:\n\nSolo Performance: Learn to research, write, direct, and perform a one-person show.\n\nMusical Theater: Some emotions and ideas can only be expressed in song. If you have dreams of Broadway, this elective can help you sing, dance, and learn the skills you need to explore the exciting world of musical theater.\n\nStand-up Comedy: If you\u2019ve always wanted to be in front of the microphone, here\u2019s your chance. Learn comic timing, observational humor, and how to interact with an audience when you\u2019re talking directly to them.\n\nThe World is a Stage Unlike other arts camps that are situated in isolated locations, the California Actors Workshop believes that one of the most important components of training for aspiring performers is to see as much professional theater as possible. For this reason, participants visit Bay Area theaters to observe hit shows and small productions. Recently attended productions include Jersey Boys, The Lion King, Rent, and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival. Students will often participate in a post-performance Q & A with actors and directors, during which they will have the opportunity to ask about techniques, artistic direction, and the life of an artist. In the classroom, instructors specifically draw on the material viewed at visited theaters. For the California Actors Workshop, the world is not only a stage but also a classroom.\n\n\u201cDrama-Free\u201d Recreation Even though the students and faculty live and breathe passion for the theater, the High School Actors Workshop students balance acting classes with daily \u201cdrama-free\u201d recreation. Students participate in a wide array of games, sports, and arts and crafts. In the evening, they come together for movie nights and special events that recall a traditional camp environment but with the added bonus of accessing the opportunities available on a college campus.',

	 'description': u'College Admission Prep Camp Intensive is a 20-day immersive program that prepares students for the increasingly competitive college admission process by providing expert instruction in SAT prep, college guidance counseling, and personal statement writing. Additionally, students visit top colleges and go on excursions to local attractions.\n\n SAT Prep\n\nStudents receive more than 50 hours of instruction and will take 5 full-length practice tests to give them test-taking practice that closely mimics the actual SAT. The classroom portion of the course will be supplemented by detailed homework assignments that will benefit students long after they have completed the instructional meetings. Each student receives a take-home kit containing lesson books, practice exams and vocabulary flashcards.\n\nPersonal Statement Instruction\n\nExpert writing instructors teach students the fundamentals of personal statement writing and guide them through the writing process. Students learn to express the self-awareness, imagination and curiosity that will make them attractive candidates to selective colleges. Students learn how to choose a topic, develop ideas, edit for content and style and avoid common pitfalls that weaken an applicant\u2019s chances of admission. Students will leave the program with three different personal statement essays that are ready or nearly ready for submission with their college applications.\n\nCollege Counseling\n\nStudents will each meet with two guidance counselors to receive plenty of feedback and insight about their personal college admission decisions. Both counselors will discuss college choices, high school planning and the college application with each student. Students will leave with a list of colleges for consideration from each counselor.\n\nExcursions and Recreation\n\nStudents will tour several prominent university campuses (selection varies by camp location) where they will meet attending students, visit campus landmarks, and ask admission personnel critical questions. Also, to provide a break from class work, students will participate in a full-day chaperoned excursion such as a whitewater-rafting trip or a visit to Disneyland (specific excursion destination is dependent on the location of your camp session, and is subject to change due to a variety of factors). Camp staff also plans a host of evening activities and campus-based recreation so students may experience the excitement of college life!',

	 'description': u"College Admission Prep Camp is an 11-day program that comprehensively prepares students for the college admissions process. It gives students the unique chance to live on a prestigious college campus, learn about college life first-hand, and prepare for significant academic opportunities with the help and guidance of experienced professionals.\n\nThe program curriculum includes three core components: SAT preparation that uses market-leading materials and instruction; personal statement writing for the college admission essay; and college counseling from an experienced staff of academic advisors.\n\nSAT Preparation: College Admission Prep Camp is an opportunity to learn the skills needed for success on the SAT, including essay writing techniques, grammar skills, advanced math and critical reading. Our experienced instructors employ the exclusive and time-tested Test Scholars SAT curriculum, which familiarizes students with all aspects of the new SAT exam. Our focus is to provide students with the test taking strategies and reasoning skills, rather than training students to rely primarily on tricks. Test Scholars students have historically scored average increases of nearly 200 points! College Admission Prep Camp is uniquely equipped to maximize SAT scores because our curriculum utilizes College Board materials. Rather than try to mimic the College Board\u2019s questions, the program purchases all exams directly from the test maker. Students receive practice workbooks and exams, and a set Test Scholars\u2019 exclusive flash cards- 800 of the most important SAT vocabulary words, plus 250 math flash cards for review of important formulas and techniques. Overall, campers receive 40 hours of supervised SAT prep. This is double what most competing mainapp_program offer and will undoubtedly ready students for this monumentally important examination.\nPersonal Statement Writing: The Personal Statement is a student\u2019s chance to show that he/she is more than a test score or grade point average. It is a significant platform for demonstrating clarity, character and unquantifiable qualifications for college admittance. To this end, College Admission Prep Camp offers every student hours of one-on-one consulting with expert writing instructors during a daily block dedicated solely to honing each student\u2019s work. From the conception of an essay topic to the final revised piece, the writing program teaches students how to write the kind of essay that will present them in the best light during the college admission process. Students learn to express the self-awareness, imagination, and curiosity that will make them attractive candidates to selective colleges. By the end of the program, each student will have written about a meaningful personal topic that is ready, or nearly ready, for submission with his or her college application.\nCollege Counseling: Even at the most prestigious private high schools the ratio of students to counselors can exceed 100:1, offering minimal individual contact and attention. College Admission Prep Camp gives each participant direct access to some of the top guidance counselors in the country. College counselors identify excellent colleges that are appropriate for each student\u2019s interests and academic background. In addition, the counselors teach students how to prepare their applications to match the expectations of college admission officers, including help with the finer points of style and phrasing. The program's counselors help students pinpoint top quality schools that are best suited to their particular needs and interests. Students leave at the end of camp with a list of potential schools that have been reviewed and discussed individually with a college counselor, advice from their counselor, and a college admission calendar that will help families avoid last minute scrambling and missed deadlines. Students also receive interview training that prepares students to present themselves in application or scholarship interviews. ",

Each instructor has a specialty in some aspect of web programming and/or design, in addition to experience working with K-12 students.\n\nUniversity Campus Life. Students at Computer Camp live in the heart of American computer innovation- the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants eat in university dining halls and take classes on-campus. They play sports on sprawling green quads, watch movies in dorm lounges, and get a taste of the exciting life of a college student on a prestigious campus.\n\nChallenging Core Curriculum. Each session gives students an opportunity to focus on a particular speciality. \n\nOur 2013 specialities that include:\n\nWeb Design (June 23 - 28 at UC Berkeley)\n\nThis component of our program\u2019s curriculum equips students with the skills to construct their own web sites.

	 'description': u'American Legal Experience offers high school students a unique opportunity to learn public speaking skills through a concentrated focus on the American judicial system. The adversarial nature of the American legal system places a premium on effective communication and persuasion through well-reasoned arguments. Therefore, our focus on this system provides students with an exciting and challenging medium for the development of speaking skills.\nAmerican Legal Experience participants will work with experienced public speaking instructors and a directing attorney to learn the structure of the court systems, differences between the process of law involved in civil and criminal trials, and most importantly proper methods of the formation and presentation of convincing legal arguments. As part of this learning process, students will be directly exposed to the basics of certain substantive areas of law, including constitutional, criminal and tort law, as well as rules of evidence.\nPast activities have included a visit to a court house for a first-hand look at the American justice system at work, participation in simulated client interviews, and professionally critiqued oral arguments. The weeklong session includes at least two mock trials, including opening statements, the examination of witnesses and introduction of evidence and closing arguments. Guest speakers such as area attorneys or judges have been regular features of recent ALE sessions.',

	 'description': u'The High School Actors Workshop focuses on teaching the professional acting techniques that translate onto both stage and screen. Over the course of 14 days, students participate in a morning core course and choose from a variety of specialized afternoon electives. Students showcase their work in an extraordinary final performance, which includes monologue work and ensemble short scenes.\nAdmission Requirements Eligible students must be entering 9th-12th grade in order to attend the High School session of the California Actors Workshop. Students must demonstrate passion for acting and theater by having taken drama classes or planning to during high school. Students are required to submit a 250 word Personal Statement that explains their interest in acting and desire to attend the program.\nCore Curriculum The core curriculum for the Actors Workshop is an acting class that focuses on combining creative intuition with concrete technical skills. Following Stanislavski, students learn to tap into emotional truth while exploring how mental and physical techniques can nurture unconscious inspiration. Each morning, students will practice exercises that help them vocally project, physically tell stories, and emotionally and intellectually connect to characters. Both morning acting classes and afternoon rehearsals help students understand the basic building blocks of realistic acting such as playing objectives (what the character wants), obstacles (what stands in the way), and tactics (how the character tries to get around those obstacles to accomplish her objectives).\nElectives Elective offerings vary each year and depend on the specialty of the acting faculty. Possible offerings include:\nSolo Performance: Learn to research, write, direct, and perform a one-person show.\nMusical Theater: Some emotions and ideas can only be expressed in song. If you have dreams of Broadway, this elective can help you sing, dance, and learn the skills you need to explore the exciting world of musical theater.\nStand-up Comedy: If you\u2019ve always wanted to be in front of the microphone, here\u2019s your chance. Learn comic timing, observational humor, and how to interact with an audience when you\u2019re talking directly to them.\nThe World is a Stage Unlike other arts camps that are situated in isolated locations, the California Actors Workshop believes that one of the most important components of training for aspiring performers is to see as much professional theater as possible. For this reason, participants visit Bay Area theaters to observe hit shows and small productions. Recently attended productions include Jersey Boys, The Lion King, Rent, and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival. Students will often participate in a post-performance Q & A with actors and directors, during which they will have the opportunity to ask about techniques, artistic direction, and the life of an artist. In the classroom, instructors specifically draw on the material viewed at visited theaters. For the California Actors Workshop, the world is not only a stage but also a classroom.\n\u201cDrama-Free\u201d Recreation Even though the students and faculty live and breathe passion for the theater, the High School Actors Workshop students balance acting classes with daily \u201cdrama-free\u201d recreation. Students participate in a wide array of games, sports, and arts and crafts. In the evening, they come together for movie nights and special events that recall a traditional camp environment but with the added bonus of accessing the opportunities available on a college campus.',

	 'description': u'What do Sponge Bob, Robin Hood, Bambi, gladiators, and boxing cats have to do with environmental ethics, ecology, animal rights, and wilderness preservation? In this program we\'ll answer that question and many more as we explore the intriguing history of human-environment relationships, from ancient Rome to the present day.\nWe\'ll use art, literature, film, cartoons, music, maps, advertising, and other cultural objects in our quest to better understand nature and culture.\nThrough these lenses, we\'ll consider the diversity of environmental values, examine cultural manifestations of nature, and explore the role of society in forming natural resource and environmental policy.\nOur studies begin with Gilgamesh in ancient Mesopotamia and move on to Medieval game laws and tales of King Arthur\'s court. We will look at Romanticism in eighteenth-century Europe and America and see how nineteenth-century trends in landscape art led to nature protection and the creation of national parks in the United States. We will also see how the introduction of film and photography forever changed how we look at nature.\nWe\'ll then examine the rise of scientific ecology as an academic field and see how the science and the metaphors of ecology continue to affect how we think about nature and the environment today. Is nature more like an organism that can be harmed or destroyed, or is nature like a machine that can be altered, repaired, and fixed?\nFinally, you will see why our metaphors about nature matter when we introduce some "pesky philosophical problems" that continue to challenge environmentalists, such as: Do mountains exist? The answer to that question may surprise you.\nThe format of the program involves primarily readings and discussions, although along the way we may meet with guest speakers, view related films, and take occasional field trips to supplement what we learn in class.\n"Nature and Culture" is based in Cornell\'s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, ranked in national surveys as the best college of agriculture and related sciences in the country.',

	 'description': u"If you're contemplating a career in architecture, or if you'd simply like to indulge your passion for it, then this intensive program is for you.\n\nLed by professors from Cornell's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP), whose undergraduate architecture program is ranked number one in the nation, you'll spend the mornings exploring architectural principles such as:\n\nComposition\nHistory\nPreservation\nLandscape architecture\nPlanning\nUrban design\nIn addition, you'll delve into the nuts and bolts of architecture, including:\nBuilding construction\nStructures\nAcoustics\nLighting\nEnergy conservation\nSustainability\nThroughout these discussions, the class will also consider the cultural, social, and political factors involved.\nYou'll spend afternoons, late evenings, and some weekend hours in AAP's new architecture studio, the Rem Koolhaas-designed Milstein Hall, where you'll put into practice what you learn in the mornings.\nTackling a major design problem is the core of this part of the program. Small design-studio seminars, intensive individual instruction, and regular progress reviews will help you prepare for the presentation of your final project. You'll be able to add your final project, as well as a wealth of architectural drawings and models, to your portfolio.\nA significant highlight of the summer is the introduction to computer-aided design. This hands-on experience is led by Cornell's world-renowned computer graphics faculty, using state-of-the-art technology. You'll also take field trips to significant sites in the area; in past years, students have visited buildings designed by Louis Kahn and Frank Lloyd Wright. Finally, you will examine works by distinguished contemporary practitioners.\nYou'll also enjoy the rare opportunity to use Cornell's Fine Arts Library, one of the oldest and most extensive architectural libraries in the world, and the chance to draw on the extraordinary resources of our distinguished university community. Faculty members and graduate teaching assistants in the Department of Architecture will work closely with you throughout the six weeks. There is one instructor for every ten to twelve students in the design studio.\nStudents successfully completing the program receive, in addition to a certificate, a total of six credits for Architecture 1110 and 1300, a letter grade for each course, and a written evaluation from their instructor. The use of the summer courses to partially or wholly fulfill basic design requirements is solely at the discretion of the institution that admits you as a degree candidate. In most cases, students receive transcript credits for the courses.\nThese rigorous six-week classes are open to both high school and college students and require no specialized knowledge or background, just a serious interest in design. Students need to come prepared to be challenged and live the life of a busy architect perfecting their craft (projects). College students should note that they must register for Architecture 1110 and 1300 through Cornell University Summer Sessions.\nThe cost of supplies for this program is about $350 (including $162\u2014this amount will likely change\u2014for the Introduction to Architecture Supply Kit.) This expense is in addition to the cost of the program.",

	 'description': u'What is the connection between genius and madness? What explains the close association between creativity and insanity found in cultures from antiquity to the present? What pushes genius or madness beyond the pale of normalcy\u2014and how do we define "normal"?\nIn Genius and Madness in Literature, you\u2019ll join others in lively discussions about these questions as we try to determine whether creativity is ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity.\nDuring this three-week program, Summer College\'s sole literature course, you\'ll learn advanced methods of critical thinking and literary analysis as we read from novels and medical works, poetry and philosophy, novellas and historical accounts. We\'ll consider canonical texts from European and American figures such as Aristotle, Plato, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Shakespeare, Immanuel Kant, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Honor\xe9 de Balzac, Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Franz Kafka, Paul Auster, Salvadore Dali, Luis Bu\xf1uel, and Thomas Mann, among others.\nWe\u2019ll trace the history of social and artistic transgression, watch films, and discuss when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad.\nMorning classes will be supplemented by daily afternoon discussion sessions and writing workshops. These are designed to improve your interpretive skills and introduce you to the fundamentals of college-level writing.\nTwice a week, you\u2019ll hear talks on related topics ranging from avant-garde film to Kant\'s philosophy of art and madness in classical music, given by guest lecturers from select humanities departments, such as comparative literature, Medieval studies, history, anthropology, art history, romance studies, German studies, music, and philosophy.\nYou\'ll also enjoy occasional field trips to the Johnson Art Museum and the Cornell University Library rare books and manuscripts collection.',

	 'description': u"This intensive introduction to psychology has long been a favorite with Summer College students. It explores how we, as individuals, understand and get along in the broader social world.\nHumans are a social species, and our connection to one another is a core element of our experience. In this program we'll examine how and why people act differently in the same situation, sometimes as a result of the culture in which they were raised, the family in which they grew up, or the genetic make-up they inherited.\nWe'll also discuss how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals.\nIn addressing these themes, we'll investigate such questions as:\nWhy do we hold stereotypes?\nHow do we decide what motivates other people's actions?\nHow are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed?\nHow do invisible social norms influence our behavior?\nWhat factors determine whom we like and love?\nWhat is the nature of emotional experience?\nWhy are people capable of great cruelty and inspiring altruism?\nAlong the way, we'll learn how these questions can be scientifically studied, so that our knowledge of human behavior can rest on a solid foundation and go beyond the speculations offered for millennia by philosophers, poets, and other astute observers.\nIn addition, we'll put our theories into action. After exploring careers in the field of psychology, we'll review selected case studies, learn basic counseling skills, and discuss the signs of depression and suicidal ideation. We'll focus on how to help a friend, and we'll meet with residents of a substance-abuse recovery center and people challenged by mental illness.",

The foundations of contemporary ideas about these concepts have their origins in antiquity, the Judeo-Christian tradition, and early modern notions of right and wrong, and of a just order.\n\nThis program, for students interested in politics, government, the history of ideas, and law, will introduce you to the rich intellectual heritage, especially related to the ideals of freedom and justice, on which the modern legal and political systems are based.\n\nUnder the leadership of Professor Isaac Kramnick, one of Cornell\'s most distinguished faculty members, you will explore readings from the "Great Books" of Western social thought: Plato, the Old and New Testaments, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Locke, Burke, Wollstonecraft, J.S. Mill, Marx, and M. L. King, Jr.\n\nThe afternoon seminars will supplement the morning\'s intellectual and philosophical inquiry. Twice each week, you\'ll meet and talk with a variety of people involved in political life, such as local judges and practicing attorneys, all of whom will describe what they do in practice and how it relates concretely to the abstract ideals of freedom and justice.

	 'description': u'Cornell University Summer College\'s intensive, six-week English Immersion Program (EIP) is designed to help you dramatically improve your academic English writing, speaking, and listening skills.\nIn addition to taking two Cornell classes for credit, you\'ll have the opportunity to experience college life at a great American university, learn from world-renowned faculty members, and build friendships with students from across the United States and around the world.\nYou\'ll gain access to Cornell\'s outstanding resources, including more than 20 libraries and cutting-edge computing services and laboratories, have the chance to participate in cultural activities, and earn college credits and a Cornell transcript. This program is an excellent choice for international students whose first language is not English.\nAs an EIP student, you\'ll take a popular Cornell University writing course, Academic Writing (WRIT 1011). This three-credit course is taught in small sections and includes frequent one-on-one instruction in the planning, composition, and revision of papers based on assigned readings and discussions.\nThe course, which is the primary focus of your academic study at Cornell, focuses on helping you improve both your written and spoken English.\nYou\'ll also take a second class for college credit. The courses you are permitted to take will be based on your English-language proficiency and cannot conflict with the writing course meeting times.\nFinally, if you\'re able to keep up with your coursework and maintain high grades in your first two courses, you may also be eligible to visit a third course, which means you would attend the class but not earn credit for it.\nThrough your classes, you\'ll gain academic knowledge, improve your English, and become familiar with the different teaching and learning styles at an Ivy League university. You will be expected to attend all classes and actively participate in classroom discussions.\nIn addition, you\'ll have access to individual tutoring through the award-winning John S. Knight Institute\'s walk-in writing service. The Knight Institute is one of the nation\'s oldest and most comprehensive writing-across-the-curriculum mainapp_program. Its excellence was recognized when the Time/Princeton Review chose Cornell as its private research university "College of the Year" on the basis of its teaching students "how to use writing as a way to learn and think."',

	 'description': u'"We hold these truths to be self-evident" is perhaps the most famous political expression in U.S. history. Among the truths the signers to the Declaration of Independence endorsed was "that all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." As the nation grew, citizens of every social class appealed to these ideas to claim their rights and to define American democracy in new ways.\nLed by award-winning professor Nick Salvatore, you\'ll explore these "truths," and the evolution of democracy and dissent in America, as you focus on some of the most dramatic and important episodes in American history, including:\nThe struggles over the place of the emancipated slaves after the Civil War\nExpanded rights for women and working people in the twentieth century\nFree-speech issues\nThe civil rights movement\nReligion-based critiques of American culture\nConservative critiques of American liberalism\nAs you examine these issues, you\'ll investigate the ways in which political expression takes different forms in modern American culture. You\'ll also explore the role of music in expressing dissent.\nAn informed citizenry is a necessary component of democracy, and the library is perhaps the most democratic of our institutions, collecting and making available information on all views and perspectives. But finding "good" information has never been so easy\u2014or so difficult. Today\'s students need to become adept at accessing and assessing information from an expanding array of sources in a variety of formats.\nAs a student in this program you\'ll also participate in a series of hands-on instruction sessions in the Uris Library Electronic Classroom, where you\'ll actively explore and work with the Cornell University Library\'s large, prestigious research collections (both print and digital), and you\'ll tour the Library\'s Rare Books and Manuscripts Division.\nYou\'ll learn strategies and techniques to enhance your lifelong research skills as you approach your college years, and you\'ll improve or refine your "information literacy"\u2014your ability to identify, retrieve, evaluate, and use information effectively and efficiently.You will also have an opportunity to explore the relation of art to dissent in a session with a curator at Cornell\'s Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art.\nAnd finally, you\'ll attend a session on the college admissions process.',

You\'ll also discover whether you\'re more at home with hand sketching or computer visualizations.\nThe design projects you\'ll complete are intended to be portfolio-worthy, and you\'ll have the opportunity to receive portfolio guidance during the program.\nIn addition to spending time in the studio, you\'ll work with glass at the Corning Museum of Glass, analyze some of the hallmarks of contemporary architecture during visits to LEED-certified buildings by Richard Meier and Rem Koolhaas, and enjoy excursions to local natural areas, where you\'ll build structures using only natural materials.\nBy studying design precedents, such as iconic chairs from Cornell\'s collections and "green" materials from the DEA library, you\'ll get up-close-and-personal with the elements that constitute both timeless design and forward-thinking innovation.\nTogether with other students and DEA faculty, you\'ll immerse yourself in the history, theory and practice of design, see how architects and designers are reducing the negative impacts of building construction and energy use, and become a part of the process of creating new knowledge about human behavior and design practice. You\'ll also learn how design professionals can help to build a more sustainable, socially responsible future for our world.\nFinally, to help you prepare for a possible future in design, admission staff will offer a seminar about the college application process and you\'ll have a chance to meet with DEA faculty and learn about design career possibilities.',

	 'description': u'In this three-week program, you\u2019ll:\nexplore the fascinating past, present, and future of health, disease, and medicine in the United States;\nexamine the ways in which medicine and its practitioners have affected\u2014and been affected by\u2014American social, political, cultural, and economic developments;\nbuild a solid base of knowledge for enriching your own perspective on disease and illness as a future health or medical professional; and\ngain a semester\u2019s worth of experience with college-level work.\nGuided by award-winning professor Joan Jacobs Brumberg, you\'ll begin by studying the changing nature of biomedical and psychiatric disease in American history. You will also consider how the profession of medicine has evolved and changed in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. You\'ll learn why doctors were not always seen as the medical experts, nor hospitals as the place to go when suffering a severe illness or trauma.\nWe will analyze how our current health care system began to take shape in the late nineteenth and early to mid-twentieth century. Focusing primarily (but not exclusively) on three specific disease examples (tuberculosis, anorexia nervosa, and AIDS), you will explore the ways in which medical ideas and clinical practice are shaped by the ideas and values of the times.\nUsing a rich variety of sources, you\'ll examine how gender, race, and social class influenced doctors and their patients. And, you\'ll see how the historical experiences of patients caused public health professionals and medical researchers to reconsider health policy and medical experimentation in the United States.\nUltimately, you\'ll have a chance to do research on a disease of your own choosing and you\'ll get "inside" the thinking of contemporary clinicians.\nThis program also serves as an excellent introduction to college-level work. You\'ll use a wide range of primary and secondary materials\u2014from scholarly and scientific articles to advertising and popular literature as well as documentary and feature films\u2014and you\'ll learn to integrate these materials with daily lectures.\nIn discussion sections with teaching assistants, you will critically examine in depth themes from course lecture and readings; in writing workshops you will learn the basics of college-level writing. You\u2019ll be evaluated based on your writing assignments, your participation in lectures and discussion sections, and your performance on a final exam.',

	 'description': u'The EPGY Differential Equations course presents basic techniques and methods for solving ordinary differential equations, covering many if not all of the topics found in most first-quarter college courses in differential equations. Emphasis is placed on understanding the general properties of solutions, as well as the fundamental structure of solution sets. This course provides a central foundation upon which many areas of both pure and applied mathematics are built.

	 'description': u'Virtually all semiconductor market domains, including PCs, game consoles, mobile handsets, servers, supercomputers, and networks, are converging to concurrent platforms. There are two important reasons for this trend. First, these concurrent processors can potentially offer more effective use of chip space and power than traditional monolithic microprocessors for many demanding applications. Second, an increasing number of applications that traditionally used Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are now implemented with concurrent processors in order to improve functionality and reduce engineering cost. The real challenge is to develop applications software that effectively uses these concurrent processors to achieve efficiency and performance goals. The aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience in developing applications software for processors with massively parallel computing resources. In general, we refer to a processor as massively parallel if it has the ability to complete more than 64 arithmetic operations per clock cycle. Many commercial offerings from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel already offer such levels of concurrency. Effectively programming these processors will require in-depth knowledge about parallel programming principles, as well as the parallelism models, communication models, and resource limitations of these processors. The target audiences of the course are students who want to develop exciting applications for these processors, as well as those who want to develop programming tools and future implementations for these processors.

Programming Abstractions assumes that you already have familiarity with good programming style and software engineering issues (at the level of Programming Methodology), and that you can use this understanding as a foundation on which to tackle new topics in programming and data abstraction. \nTopics: Abstraction and its relation to programming. Software engineering principles of data abstraction and modularity. Object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (such as stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design. Recursion and recursive data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs). Introduction to time and space complexity analysis. Uses the programming language C++ covering its basic facilities.\nPrerequisites: Solid performance in Programming Methodology and readiness to move on to advanced programming topics.

	 'description': u'"The Stanford University Online High School (OHS) is an independent school for gifted students in grades 7-12. The school was founded in 2006 as a three-year high school with a gift from the Malone Family Foundation, which also enabled its expansion to include a middle school with an additional gift in 2009. OHS has been accredited by WASC since 2006 and has been approved as an online provider by the University of California since 2008.\n\nThe mission of OHS is to provide a stimulating and challenging education that equips and inspires talented students to academic and professional success. Our approach to fulfilling this mission consists in an emphasis on rigorous and advanced academic offerings, the development of skills in written and oral communication, acquisition of a mastery of the principles of critical thinking and argumentation, and the promotion of intellectual maturity and responsibility. Beginning at the earliest grades, this mission informs the academic program that OHS students pursue, in the content of its classes, the methods and media of instruction, and the composition of the required courses of study.  Students are guided through their studies by instructors who are chosen for their expertise and accomplishment in their disciplines and their experience and dedication to teaching highly talented students at the high school and college levels.\n\nThe flexibility of OHS academic program and enrollment options, which include full-time, part-time, and single course enrollment, can accommodate the varied needs and interests of our students. The online instruction, which combines seminar-style and directed-study courses on a flexible college-style class schedule, both encourages independence, discipline, and strong time-management skills and allows our students to pursue their diverse interests and exceptional talents.\n\nThe strong community at OHS supports students in acclimating to our academically rigorous environment. Students work closely with instructors, counselors and each other to achieve their academic and personal goals. Beyond the online classroom, students engage in a rich array of student clubs that build on student interests. An intensive residential summer program at Stanford University presents students with further opportunity to connect with each other and their instructors, while learning about and preparing for college and benefitting from the vast resources of Stanford University."\n',

The program allows students the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with outstanding faculty in a research intensive setting. The seven-week program also includes weekly seminars, discussions, and field trips. The students are afforded an atmosphere designed to develop their critical thinking abilities and career interests with faculty and other students like themselves. Students are selected on the basis of their academic accomplishments, letters of recommendation and career objectives. For the 2011 program, appointments were very competitive. For example, the average SAT score for the 12 participants was greater than 2276 and PSAT was greater than 223.\n\nThe Clark Scholars Program is unique in that it is open to gifted students in almost any area of academe from not only the natural sciences and mathematics but to the humanities and fine arts as well. Many of these Clark Scholars have used their research experience to help formulate their career paths and goals. The Clark Scholars Program was created by a generous endowment from the Anson L. Clark Foundation and to date has provided more than 250 students the opportunity to work with outstanding, dedicated faculty in one-on-one, hands on research experiences. Texas Tech is extremely proud of the faculty and Clark Scholars. Their collaborative efforts have established this program as one of the premiere educational experience for pre-college students.',

Then you will be sent from the application to Acceptd where you will (a) enter your contact information, (b) upload your audition material, and (c) pay a $50 application fee.\nRather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips:  the introduction, the first song, and the second song.  It\u2019s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot.  We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video.  Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions.  Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.\nIntroduction:  Please say your name clearly, the date, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do.\nTwo songs:  Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. One of your songs must be in English and the other in a foreign language \u2013 Italian, German, or French. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment \u2013 try different distances from the sound source until you find the right \u201cbalance\u201d between piano and voice.\nResume:  Your resume should reflect your experience as a performing artist and may include experience and training in solo voice, choral, theater, musical instruments and dance. Please include foreign language study and any special skills that you would like to share with us.\nHeadshot or recent photograph:  Again we are not looking for a professional quality photograph.  If you have a headshot, that is fine.  If not, a recent snapshot will suffice.\nAfter uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials.  After those materials have been reviewed you will be contacted with more information.\nPlease note that there is no financial aid offered in conjunction with this workshop. </p>',

	 'description': u"Theatre Bridge and Playwrights Workshop offer a connecting link between high school and college theatre and encourage a commitment to a life of creative engagement. The highly selective mainapp_program provide promising young actors and playwrights an opportunity to stretch their imaginations and skills as they create new work under the mentorship of established theatre professionals. Students work alongside the artists of the Brown/Trinity Playwrights Rep and the undergraduate Apprentice Company, and are encouraged to achieve their highest potential. Residential Advisors are carefully selected Brown undergraduates, who serve as mentors and role models to help students make the most of their time at Brown.\nTheatreBridge\nActing faculty will draw from the Meisner technique which includes interdependent series of exercises that build upon one another. Meisner's technique is based on the idea that acting finds its most profound expression in specific behavior that comes from the actor's real human response to situations and other people. As actors, students will rely heavily on accessing their impulses, through which real responses and real behavior can be accessed in the moment. This technique is applied to improvisation with another person as well as the actor's way of finding things to do in rehearsal, interpreting a script, and creating the specific physical characteristics of each character the actor played.\nPlaywrights Workshop\nThe workshop for emerging playwrights is designed to create a supportive and stimulating environment for young writers to develop and share their writing.  Student-playwrights will have the opportunity to write and work alongside the actors, directors and playwrights of the Brown/Trinity Playwrights Rep and the undergraduate Apprentice Company. By the end of the summer, students will have written and revised a complete play, explored the major elements of drama (plot, character, thought, language, rhythm and spectacle) and experimented with puppetry, devised theatre, and other theatrical genres.  Writing prompts and improvisation as well as reading and analyzing plays will be a part of the process. As playwriting is a time-space based art form focused on human interaction, the professional company will also perform students\u2019 writing in staged readings at the end of the program.",

The lecturer isn\'t bad, but while I love my lab instructor the labs are boring if you have experience (I finish early all the time with my lab partner and sit with my laptop for like an hour). \n\nThings I dislike:\n\na) The clickers. They\'re supposed to measure how much you did the homework, but in all honesty it\'s a stupid idea. \nb) Journal clubs. Boring.\nc) The rules. The staff are really friendly but there are so many limits, it\'s like you can\'t even explore Philadelphia. Room times are ridiculously early, and you have to get lucky with dorms. I\'m in a dorm that looks like a prison.

	 'description': u"This unique interdisciplinary humanities course takes students to Greece where they have the extraordinary opportunity to study ancient Greek drama in its literary and social contexts. A series of excursions to sites related to the works they read, both within and outside Athens, supplement the core of the program on the island of Spetses.\n\nStudents first arrive in Chicago for pre-departure orientation, program overview, and discussion about safety while living abroad. Afterward students and the program leaders depart for Athens where, under the direction of an archaeologist, students explore sites and museums integral to the curriculum's theme: the religious, dramatic, and political centers of the Acropolis, the Theatre of Dionysos, and the Athenian Agora. The archaeological portion of the program also includes trips to Delphi and Mycenae, culminating in a visit to the ancient theatre of Epidauros.\n\nHaving gained an archeological sense of the importance of dramatic performance, the group will then proceed to the island of Spetses, Greece, for the classroom portion of the program. Program directors will guide students in close readings and critical analysis of selected works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, with supplementary readings in Aristotle's Poetics and other works relating to Greek drama. The daily program while on Spetses consists of tailored instruction in modern Greek, seminar discussions of the works studied, and lectures on Greek drama and its production in classical Athens. In addition, students will have the opportunity to explore the local museums as well as visit the nearby island of Hydra.  Students can rent bicycles, go swimming, or explore the streets and beaches on foot.  The program concludes with a farewell dinner in Athens.",

	 'description': u"Join Field Museum Vice President of Research and Collections Lance Grande for a four-week intensive practicum in paleontology. Go into the field and behind the scenes at the Field Museum to learn how fossils are collected, analyzed, and conserved, as you work alongside museum scientists in the lab and in the field.\n\nIn Chicago, Grande and other Field Museum scientists will take you into the labs and galleries where they work and study as they introduce you to important concepts in geology, paleontological method, stratigraphy, and earth history. You will also learn about basic techniques for the study of evolutionary biology including comparative skeletal anatomy of fishes and other freshwater animals. You will also examine methodological concepts such as fossil preparation, illustration, and description. In this way, you will acquire the fundamental scientific background needed to discover and understand the significance of fossils in the field.\n\nThen, experience what life in the field is all about when you join the ongoing Field Museum expedition in the Green River Formation. This site is one of the world's productive fossil sites and contains an entire 52-million-year-old community of extinct organisms. Previous expeditions to the Green River Formation have led Dr. Grande and his team to uncover thousands of fossils, including plants, insects, mammals, crocodiles, birds, lizards, turtles, and fishes, many of which are currently on display at the museum. Spend your mornings and late afternoon prospecting for fossils from the Cenozoic Period and interpret them in a way that allows you to incorporate fossils into studies of living animals and plants. In the early afternoon and evenings, you can go into town for provisions, help prepare meals for your fellow diggers, and sit around the campfire with the museum's researchers and their families. When you return to Chicago, you will conserve, catalog, and analyze your new discoveries in the museum's preparation labs, using the same techniques and equipment that the museum's own staff uses.",

	 'description': u'Understanding how stars work- what makes them shine- is one of the great accomplishments of 20th-century science. The theory of stellar structure allows us to investigate the interiors of stars, even though what we observe is radiation from their outer atmospheres. This theory also helps us determine how old stars are, how they create heavier nuclei from lighter nuclei in their centers, and how they evolve from birth to death, ending as a white dwarf, a neutron star, or perhaps a black hole. This course introduces you to the concepts behind and applications of this crucial breakthrough.\nWe will review the basic physical principles that help us understand how stars work- gravity, pressure, radiations, and how radiation interacts with matter- and apply them to further our understanding of stellar structure. We will collect our own measurements of stellar properties, such as the masses, sizes and luminosities of stars, using robotic telescopes controlled via the internet and those at the University\u2019s Yerkes Observatory. Using this and other data, we will test the theory of stellar structure and explore what it can tell us about the universe.',

	 'description': u'As society moves towards embracing sustainability, the business sector plays a critical role in driving change. While some environmentalists have attacked the business community for contributing to environmental problems, the corporate sector is also forging different solutions and approaches. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, and group research projects, you will learn how to compute the economic rationale behind various sustainable business practices, such as how sustainability can create value within an organization and its supply chain and how regulatory and tax incentives in different countries can affect sustainable practices. Guest speakers, such as a sustainability communications expert, a cognitive behavioral psychologist, and an environmental economist, and a field trip to a local corporation tackling these issues will put us on the front lines in figuring out how sustainability can be integrated into global business.',

In this class, we will explore this transition by studying the theories of developmental psychology, examining the relationship between the mind and the brain as it changes from infancy through adolescence. We will focus on primary empirical sources investigating the development and integration of perceptual, cognitive, and social skills. Lecture and discussion will emphasize the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and sociocultural elements throughout the life span in domains such as language, intentionality, morality and behavioral action. Students will conduct guided observational studies with infants, young children, and adolescents, and then will develop and execute their own experimental research projects in small groups.',

	 'description': u"What does art do, what does it mean, and why does it matter? This intensive course in analytical writing at the collegiate level will offer a chance to think through these questions and to craft rhetorically- effective essays that debate the purpose and effectiveness of art, from visual art to film and theater to literary creations. For some, art belongs behind glass as a curiosity in a museum. For others, it is an explosive force that has the power to reshape the very world in which we live. In the morning sessions, we will explore the questions of how these works of art structure and form our lives and how art can be used to change the world. Our exploration will take us through major literary texts by writers like Oscar Wilde and T.S. Eliot, critical philosophy by visionary thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Walter Benjamin, and some of the most striking visual and filmic art of the 20th century, such as the paintings of Frida Kahlo and Fritz Lang's film Metropolis. In the afternoon, we will work closely to develop and refine the techniques of writing that will allow each student to transform those readings into powerful essays, using rhetorical instruction materials and small group workshops that replicate the intensive writing seminars taken by University of Chicago undergraduates. Taken together, the two components of this course offer an opportunity to participate in the University's culture of critical thinking and writing.",

	 'description': u'The program is an eight-week program in which high school students from diverse backgrounds are invited to perform basic research with Stanford faculty, postdoctoral fellows, students and researchers on a medically-oriented project. The goals of the program include increasing interest in biological sciences and medicine in high school students, helping students to understand how scientific research is performed, and increasing diversity of students and researchers in the sciences.\n\nIntern Program and Benefits\n\nStudents learn about basic laboratory techniques including safety, learn the basics in the field they are studying (like stem cells or neuroscience) and gathering, analyzing and presenting scientific data. In addition, the students make scientific connections with faculty, students and postdoctoral fellows.\n\nHowever, during most of the time (interns work a minimum of 40 hours; many choose to work more), interns work doing basic research along side their mentors. Interns also participate in regular lab activities like lab meetings. \n\nIntern Accomplishments\n\nOur interns have made some outstanding discoveries and have been noted for a number of accomplishments. Five Interns have been selected as Intel Science Talent Search semifinalists, and one was a finalist; two interns have been named as semifinalists in the Siemens Competition in Science, Technology and Math. One received a Best Paper Award in the Synopsys Science Competition. Approximately 80% of our interns have gone on to major in science in college.\n',

They will spend the first two weeks intensively studying and researching a topic in history or philosophy, attending daily lectures by the faculty members, and participating in group discussions and activities in the afternoon. There will also be downtime for extra-curricular fun, as well as supervised off-campus excursions to places of cultural and natural interest around the Bay Area.\nDuring their third week, students will work closely with their professors, graduate students, and writing mentors to produce original research projects. These papers present an opportunity for students to use what they have learned at Stanford to develop their own answers to the central questions that are addressed by the humanities. Students will be introduced to research methods, as well as to library and online resources. And they\u2019ll have something very impressive to show for it!',

	 'description': u'PROMYS is a challenging program designed to encourage ambitious high school students to explore the creative world of mathematics. Each summer, approximately 80 high school students from around the country gather on the campus of Boston University for six weeks of rigorous mathematical activity. Through their intensive efforts to solve an assortment of unusually challenging problems in Number Theory, participants will practice the art of mathematical discovery. The problem sets encourage students to design their own numerical experiments and to employ their own powers of analysis to discover mathematical patterns, formulate and test conjectures, and justify their ideas by devising their own mathematical proofs. \nStudents are advised by resident counselors: junior counselors who have just graduated high school and undergraduate counselors who are embarking on their own mathematical careers at some of the finest universities (over half attend Harvard, MIT, or Princeton). In addition, the returning students, who share dormitory rooms with the first-year students, are a constant source of helpful hints and suggestions. Senior mathematicians and Distinguished Alums in Residence are a constant resource providing mathematical support and encouragement to the students.',
